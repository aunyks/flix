# Flix

**Flix** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total, since I did part 1 and 2 in one try.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity  
* [x] (8pts) Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity.
* [x] (2pts) Allow video posts to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.  

I followed part 2 before knowing that it was a continuation from part 1, so it was tricky to discover which features belonged in which assignment. Ultimately, though, I decided to submit the same work for both since it's the same project.
